Lambdaficator is the Tool which I was assigned to work on.

This tool is integrated with official distribution of Netbeans and works only with JDK version of 8 and above.

I have installed JDK 8 , netbeans in this image.

For testing purposes, I have created a project called Tool_Test in netbeans. 

I have also created two java files. one is Functional_Operations_test.java and other is Lambda_Expression_Test.java.

Lambdaficator is used for code refactoring purposes.

Here is the link for the paper 
http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486986

Test 1:
The first refactoring converts anonymous inner classes to lambda expressions.
This can be tested in Lambda_Expression_Test.java file.
I have written a code with an innerclass code. You can see a code hint on the left hand side, if you click it , it asks you to "use lambda expression". If you click that inner class code willbe changed to lambda expression.

Test 2:
The second refactoring converts for loops that iterate over Collections to functional operations that use lambda expressions.
This can be tested in Functional_Operations_test.java file.
I have written sample code using a for loop that iterates over a collection. A code hint is displayed on the left hand side, if you click it, it will ask you to "use functional operation". If you click that, code will be refactored.

There is no executable for this tool.
We have confirmed this from authors of the tool too.
